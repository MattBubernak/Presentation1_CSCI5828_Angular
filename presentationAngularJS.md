#Overview
* A user visits the AngularJS app.
* The view presents the app's data through the use of expressions, filters, and directives. Directives bind new behavior HTML elements.
* A user clicks an element in the view. If the element has a directive, AngularJS runs the function.
* The function in the controller updates the state of the data.
* The view automatically changes and displays the updated data. The page doesn't need to reload at any point.
