#Introduction
* AngularJS is a Javascript web framework aimed at making web applications easy to build and maintain.
* It is an open source Google Web Application Framework.
* AngularJS is a MVC or MVVC based framework.
* It is built for single web page applications.
  1. The application page never reloads or transfers to other pages. 
  2. Makes use of dynamic communication with the server.


# Why AngularJS?
* It is a bridge that helps convert static documents like HTML into dynamic applications. It does so by teaching the browers new syntax through a construct called **directives**.
* AngularJS eliminates the following approaches to making static documents dynamic:
  1. **Libraries**: Using libraries, the code writted by developers call the library functions. Example: jQuery, etc. 
  2. **Frameworks**: Using Frameworks, the framework controls the code written by the developer. Example: ember, durandal, etc. 
* AngularJS provides reusable code components. 
* AngularJS code is unit testable. Thus aiding in the development and testing processes.

# Unique feature(s) of AngularJS
* It extends HTML to present dynamic content through **2-way data binding**. 
    1. Unlike traditional MVC architecture where the one way data binding occurs, in AngularJS there is automatic synchronization of data between Model and View in the MVC architecture. Changes to the View is reflected in the Model and vice versa.

# Basic Concepts - AngularJS
* Template: HMTL file with additional markup
* Directives: extend HTML with custom elements and attributes
* View: what is seen by the user
* Model: data that is displayed in the View
* Controller: the business logic behind the View
* Scope:
