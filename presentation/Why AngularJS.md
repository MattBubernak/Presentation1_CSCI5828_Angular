# Why AngularJS?
* It is a bridge that helps convert static documents like HTML into dynamic applications. It does so by teaching the browers new syntax through a construct called **directives**.
* AngularJS eliminates the following approaches to making static documents dynamic:
  1. **Libraries**: Using libraries, the code writted by developers call the library functions. Example: jQuery, etc. 
  2. **Frameworks**: Using Frameworks, the framework controls the code written by the developer. Example: ember, durandal, etc. 
* AngularJS provides reusable code components. 
* AngularJS code is unit testable. Thus aiding in the development and testing processes.
