#AngularJS - Conclusion
* In conclusion, AngularJS is advantageous to developers and aids the process of software engineering in the following ways:
  1. AngularJS uses two way data binding and eliminates the need to write much code on the server side to process the data. It also makes the applications developed more responsive to the end uesr.
  2. AngularJS provides developers the ability to write less code hence aiding in the process of software development and making maintainability easier. It does so by:
      1. MVC architecture code is easy to write and easy to maintain.
      2. AngularJS provides routing ability that in turn provides the ability to create single page application that is able to reload multiple contents without having to actually reload the currently displayed page. This makes it easier/faster to write the code for single page applications.

* However, AngularJS does come with it's own set of disadvantages. Going back to the idea provided by Fred Brooks in the article 'No Silver Bullet', even though AngularJS attempts to tackle the issue of complexity around making single page applications, inadvertently, it creates a new set of problems. The following are the disadvantages to using AngularJS:
  1. Being a Javascript framework, AngularJS applications are not safe because they won't make use of server side authentication and authorization to keep the applications secure.
  2. If Javascript is disabled in the web browsers, users won't be able to run applications making use of Javascript.
