# Basic AngularJS Directives
* ng-app:<a name="ngapp"></a> Declares the root element of an AngularJS application, under which directives can be used to declare bindings and define behavior.
* ng-bind: Sets the text of a DOM element to the value of an expression. For example, `<span ng-bind="name"></span>` will display the value of ‘name’ inside the span element.
* ng-model: <a name="ngmodel"></a> Similar to ng-bind but establishes a two-way data binding between the view and the scope.
* ng-repeat:<a name="ngrepeat"></a> Instantiate an element once per item from a collection.
* ng-view: <a name="ngview"></a> Helps routing the program to different pages without the need to refresh the displayed page.
* ngRoute: <a name="ngroute"></a> Provides routing and deeplinking services and directives for AngularJS applications.
